# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Overview

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining the power of retrieval systems with generative capabilities. This approach allows models to access and utilize external knowledge sources during generation, resulting in more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable responses.

## Key Components

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
- **Document Loading**: Importing documents from various sources (PDFs, websites, databases)
- **Text Splitting**: Chunking documents into manageable pieces
- **Text Embedding**: Converting text chunks into vector representations

### 2. Vector Store
- Storage system for embedding vectors
- Enables semantic search and similarity matching
- Examples: Chroma, FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate

### 3. Retrieval System
- Query processing
- Semantic search
- Retrieval strategies (similarity, hybrid, re-ranking)

### 4. Generation with Context
- Prompt engineering with retrieved context
- Response synthesis by the LLM
- Citation and source attribution

## Common RAG Architectures

1. **Basic RAG**: Simple retrieve-then-generate approach
2. **Contextual RAG**: Retrieval based on conversation history
3. **Multi-step RAG**: Iterative retrieval and reasoning
4. **Adaptive RAG**: Dynamic adjustment of retrieval strategy

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Relevance**: Are retrieved documents relevant to the query?
- **Accuracy**: Is the generated response factually correct?
- **Faithfulness**: Does the response adhere to the retrieved context?
- **Comprehensiveness**: Does the response cover all aspects of the query?

## Best Practices

- Optimize chunk size for your specific use case
- Implement metadata filtering for targeted retrieval
- Consider hybrid search approaches (keyword + semantic)
- Perform query transformation to improve retrieval
- Implement re-ranking for better document selection

## Getting Started

To begin implementing RAG with LangChain, refer to the example scripts in this directory and the [LangChain RAG documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/).
